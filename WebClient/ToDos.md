# To Do List

1. Change links to use topic names (Stress, Depression, etc.) as Forum names instead of topic0, topic1, etc.
2. Loading before Topics get loaded on Topics page
3. Maybe add back to chats button on the Messages page
4. Either refactor CreateDiscussions page to be a Modal OR create a Cancel button to it.
