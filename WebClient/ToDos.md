# To Do List

- Change links to use topic names (Stress, Depression, etc.) as Forum names instead of topic0, topic1, etc.
- Show loading UI before Topics get loaded on Topics page.
- Maybe add back to chats button on the Messages page.
- Either refactor CreateDiscussions page to be a Modal OR create a Cancel button to it.
- Similarly for Login and Signup page, add cancel button which takes user back to previous page.
- Refactor code to have a common fetcher code instead of calling fetch in all files.
- Introduce linting.
- Have interface and types for everything.
- In long run need to setup syncing (When two people message it should reflect on both of their apps) âœ¨ðŸ˜®ðŸ”£
- Right now the views in the Messages page increment even on loading.ðŸ˜… (Need to fix that!)
- Make topic search more HiFi. Currently it just loops through Topic names and matches string.
- Forms should submit on pressing enter.
- Bring in Hover effects and more CSS.
- When everything is done, add a way to upload picture.
- And when ready to be launched have capability to verify the user âœŒ
- Add footer.
